# Data-Augmentation


## Overview

Explored the benefit of data augmentation on the learning performance on [CIFAR10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset. CIFAR10 is a standard image classification dataset frequently used as a benchmark for machine learning algorithms.

The data sugmentations used are Mixup, Cutout, Standard and combining them all togeather, all of which are implemented without using libraries.
